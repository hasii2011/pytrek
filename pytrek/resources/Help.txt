a fleet of enemy warships which are menacing the United Federation of Planets.

You have a specified number of star dates in which to complete your mission.

You also have a few Federation star bases for resupplying your ship.

*****************
* DAMAGE REPORT *
*****************
Mnemonic:  DAMAGES
Shortest abbreviation:  DA

  At any time you may ask for a damage report to find out what devices
  are damaged and how long it will take to repair them.  Naturally,
  repairs proceed faster at a starbase.

  Damage reports are free.  They use no energy or time, and can be done
  safely even in the midst of battle.


********************
* DOCK AT STARBASE *
********************
Mnemonic:  DOCK
Shortest abbreviation:  D

  You may dock your starship whenever you are in one of the eight
  sector positions immediately adjacent to a starbase.  When you dock,
  your starship is resupplied with energy, shield energy, photon
  torpedoes, and life support reserves.  Repairs also proceed faster at
  starbase, so if some of your devices are damaged, you may wish to
  stay at base (by using the "REST" command) until they are fixed.  If
  your ship has more than its normal maximum energy (which can happen
  if you've loaded crystals) the ship's energy is not changed.

  You may not dock while in standard orbit around a planet.

  Star-bases have their own deflector shields, so you are completely
  safe from phaser attack while docked.  You are also safe from
  long-range tractor beams.

  Star-bases also have both short and long range sensors, which you can
  use if yours are broken. There's also a subspace radio to get
  information about happenings in the galaxy. Mr. Spock will update the
  star chart if your ask for it while docked and your own radio is dead.

 ***************
 * WARP FACTOR *
 ***************
 Mnemonic:  WARP
 Shortest abbreviation:  W
 Full command:  WARP <number>

  Your warp factor controls the speed of your starship.  The larger the
  warp factor, the faster you go and the more energy you use.

  Your minimum warp factor is 1.0 and your maximum warp factor is 10.0
  (which is 100 times as fast and uses 1000 times as much energy).  At
  speeds above warp 6 there is some danger of causing damage to your
  warp engines; this damage is larger at higher warp factors and also
  depends on how far you go at that warp factor.

  At exactly warp 10 there is some probability of entering a so-called
  "time warp" and being thrown forward or backward in time.  The farther
  you go at warp 10, the greater is the probability of entering the
  time warp.

**************
* STAR CHART *
**************
Mnemonic:  CHART
Shortest abbreviation:  C

  As you proceed in the game, you learn more and more about what things
  are where in the galaxy. When ever you first do a scan in a quadrant,
  telemetry sensors are ejected which will report any changes in the
  quadrant(s) back to your ship, providing the sub-space radio is
  working. Spock will enter this information in the chart. If the radio
  is not working, Spock can only enter new information discovered from
  scans, and information in other quadrants may be obsolete.

  The chart looks like an 8 by 8 array of numbers.  These numbers are
  interpreted exactly as they are on a long-range scan. A period (.) in
  place of a digit means you do not know that information yet.  For
  example, ... means you know nothing about the quadrant, while .1.
  means you know it contains a base, but an unknown number of Klingons
  and stars.

  Looking at the star chart is a free operation.  It costs neither time
  nor energy, and can be done safely whether in or out of battle.

*******************
* LONG-RANGE SCAN *
*******************
Mnemonic:  LRSCAN
Shortest abbreviation:  L

  A long-range scan gives you general information about where you are
  and what is around you.  Here is an example output.

      Long-range scan for Quadrant 5 - 1
         -1  107  103
         -1  316    5
         -1  105 1000

  This scan says that you are in row 5, column 1 of the 8 by 8 galaxy.
  The numbers in the scan indicate how many of each kind of thing there
  is in your quadrant and all adjacent quadrants.  The digits are
  interpreted as follows.

      Thousands digit:  1000 indicates a supernova (only)
      Hundreds digit:   number of Klingons present
      Tens digit:       number of star-bases present
      Ones digit:       number of stars present

  For example, in your quadrant (5 - 1) the number is 316, which
  indicates 3 Klingons, 1 starbase, and 6 stars.  The long-range
  scanner does not distinguish between ordinary Klingons and Klingon
  command ships.  If there is a supernova, as in the quadrant below and
  to your right (quadrant 6 - 2), there is nothing else in the
  quadrant.

  Romulans possess a "cloaking device" which prevents their detection
  by long-range scan.  Because of this fact, Starfleet Command is never
  sure how many Romulans are "out there".  When you kill the last
  Klingon, the remaining Romulans surrender to the Federation.

  Planets are also undetectable by long-range scan.  The only way to
  detect a planet is to find it in your current quadrant with the
  short-range sensors.

  Since you are in column 1, there are no quadrants to your left. The
  minus ones indicate the negative energy barrier at the edge of the
  galaxy, which you are not permitted to cross.

  Long-range scans are free.  They use up no energy or time, and can be
  done safely regardless of battle conditions.

********
* REST *
********
Mnemonic:  REST
Shortest abbreviation:  R
Full command:  REST <NUMBER OF STAR DATES>

  This command simply allows the specified number of star dates to go
  by.  This is useful if you have suffered damages and wish to wait
  until repairs are made before you go back into battle.

  It is not generally advisable to rest while you are under attack by
  Klingons.
